# Traffic-Accidents
This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve road safety and decision-making. The analysis is performed using Power BI, SQL, and Python (Pandas) to clean, transform, and visualize the data efficiently.

Key Analysis
1. Time-Based Analysis
Extracted hours from timestamps while grouping times into standard 12-hour AM/PM format.
Identified accident frequency per hour of day, day of the week, month of year.
2. Weather & Environmental Factors
Assessed how weather conditions impact accident severity.
Identified correlations between temperature, lighting, roadway condition and crash rates.

Key Insights & Findings
Peak accident hours occur between rush hours (3-5PM).
Weekends show a higher rate of severe crashes.
Certain intersections and roads have recurring accident patterns.
